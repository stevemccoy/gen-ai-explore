Stable Diffusion Demo

On 3rd October 2023 I attended a meeting with the Nottingham Data Science and AI Meetup Group.
The meeting was to discuss and demonstrate the generative AI capabilities in the new SDXL (Stable Diffusion XL) package by Stability AI.

It is hosted as a cloud-based service by replicate.com
This allows generative AI models to be used to generate images from text prompts, among other things.

The demo is best seen when you have signed up for an account on Replicate and then the client library can be accessed through an API using a registered token. Models are accessible through Python, Node.js, Swift, Elixir and Go clients. There are some other languages covered by community maintained clients for Replicate (C#, Ruby, Rails, other JS).

As described in the Meetup notes, at https://www.meetup.com/nottingham-artificial-intelligence-meetup/events/294971398/?read=1&_xtd=gatlbWFpbF9jbGlja9oAJGQ4ODMzMmYzLThjZGMtNGM1My04MTBkLWMzOThiZDY2ODg5MQ%253D%253D&_af=event&_af_eid=294971398

One option is to make use of the pre-built models available on Replicate.com. Alternatively you can create and fine-tune your own Stable Diffusion model and use it to generate images based on your own provided training set.

Here's a blog on how to fine-tune SDXL with your own images: https://replicate.com/blog/fine-tune-sdxl
